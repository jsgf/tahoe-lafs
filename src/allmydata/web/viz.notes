* bugs
** scroll events fail on FF5 (work on Chrome)
   - both scroll-up and scroll-down cause zoom-in
   - scroll-up should be zoom-in, -down should be zoom-out
** DONE some rules get left on screen
** DONE range of x() changes, ticks narrow to only part of width
** tooltips (title=) fails on chrome, works on FF
* new features
** should clip text to size of rect, to avoid overlap
** put tick timestamps on top too, not just bottom
** add landscape (like in d3/examples/zoom/)
** double-click on box should zoom to make that box 80% of width
** consider adding vertical scroll? dubious.
** add zoom/unzoom +/- buttons
** BIG: live data update, incremental
** add misc-events, show Coalesce patch is working
