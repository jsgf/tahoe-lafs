* bugs
** scroll events fail on FF5 (work on Chrome)
   - both scroll-up and scroll-down cause zoom-in
   - scroll-up should be zoom-in, -down should be zoom-out
** DONE some rules get left on screen
** DONE range of x() changes, ticks narrow to only part of width
** tooltips (title=) fails on chrome, works on FF
* new features
** should clip text to size of rect, to avoid overlap
   - look at svg:clipPath, or svg:mask
** put tick timestamps on top too, not just bottom
** add zoom/unzoom +/- buttons
*** get buttons to work with drag-based pan+zoom
    - mouse clicks are firing two actions: button click and pan
    - I suspect they're happening reentrantly, and the pan is undoing the
      zoom
*** make zoom/unzoom buttons float above rest of chart
*** add zoom/unzoom slider
** add landscape (like in d3/examples/zoom/, calls it "context view")
   - want decimated dataset
   - just use read() and segment() sections
** double-click on box should zoom to make that box 80% of width
*** pan/zoom currently uses double-click to mean "zoom in"
*** need to distinguish between 2click-on-bar and 2click-on-background
** add misc-events, show Coalesce patch is working
** BIG: live data update, incremental
** consider adding vertical scroll? dubious.
